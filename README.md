# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 12

This is the optimized solution for [day 12] in Rust. The current runtime for
both parts on my M1 Pro is 600Î¼s. For comparision, my unoptimized Python
solution runs in 180ms (300x speed up).

The main idea is to use bottom up dynamic programming and cache as much as
possible.
